What you know about rollin’
down in the deep?
When your brain goes numb you
can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much
put that shit in slow motion,
yeah
I feel like an astronaut
in the ocean, ayy

I feel like an astronaut
in the ocean
She say that I’m cool
Damn right
I’m like
“Yeah, that’s true”
That’s true
I believe in G-O-D
Ayy
Don’t believe in T-H-O-T
She keep playing me dumb
Playing me
I’ma play her for fun
Uh-hu
Y’all don’t really know
my mental
Let me give you the picture
like stencil
Fallin’ out, in a drough
No flow, rain wasn’t
pourin’ down
Pourin’ down
See that pain was all around
See my mode was kinda lounge
Didn’t know which,
which way to turn
Flow was cool,
but I still felt burnt
Energy up,
you can feel my surge
I’ma kill everything like
this purge
Ayy
Let’s just get this straight
for a second, I’ma work
Even if I don’t get paid
for progression, I’ma get it
Get it
Everything that I do
is electric
Ayy
I’ma keep it inner motion,
keep it movin’ like kinetic,
ayy
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Put this shit in a frame but
I know I don’t blame
Every day that I say,
“Man, I seen you deflate”
Let me elevate,
this ain’t a prank
Have you woken on a plank
La-la-la-la, like
“Oh pass together,
God let me pray”
Now let me pray
I’ve been going right,
right around, caught a relay
Pass the baton,
back to the mall
Swimming in the pool,
can’t drink ’em all, uh
Wanna piece of this,
a piece of mama, a piece of Xan
Can you please read between
the lines?
My rhyme’s inclined to break
your spine
They say that I’m so fine
You could never match my crime
Please do not now waste my time
