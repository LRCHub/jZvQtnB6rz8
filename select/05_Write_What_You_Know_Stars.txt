Write what you know
Keep the story funny
Have a happy ending
Make the female sexy
Sing it for the people
Hope they sing along
Yeah, they're gonna love it
And I will think it's strong
Fall into a corner, writer
Watch your favorite show
Pray to God to see her
Write what you know
Write what you know
Write what you know
Write what you know

Go and be a pony
In the pony show
Dance with other ponies
Got your fuckin' dope
Time entwines around you
Leads you through the door
Telephone is silent
We don't like calls anymore

Forget how to cry
The future is the dark
The future is the dark
Write what you know
Write what you know
Write what you know
Write what you know
Write what you know
Write what you know
Write what you know
Write what you know
Write what you know
Write what you know

Write what you know
Keep that story funny
Have a happy ending
Make the female sexy
This ending is so sexy
This ending is so sexy
This ending is so
This ending is so
This ending is so
This ending is so sexy
This ending is so
This ending is so sexy
