Oh father, please
Please forgive all my sins
The water is way too deep
The deep end is where I live

Father, please
There's blood all over these sheets
The devil is in the mirror
He's staring right over me

I always thought it would be easy (easy)
To get you out my mind (mind)
I think I found a new addiction
It feels so right

Run, baby, run
Run for your life
I'ma tear out your heart
It'll always be mine

Run, baby, run
Run for your life
Gonna tear out your heart
It'll always be mine

Oh, there she go
Losing my head
Say you'll love me to death
'Cause I will

Oh, there she go
Show me you care
Say you'll always be there
'Cause I will

Oh father, please
Please don't waste any time
The sirens are turning red
I found a whole another vice

Father, please
She's perfect in your design
She's covered in Saint Laurent
You've shown me the holy light

I always thought it would be easy (easy)
To get you out my mind (mind)
I think I found a new addiction
It feels so right

Run, baby, run
Run for your life
I'ma tear out your heart
It'll always be mine

Run, baby, run
Run for your life
Gonna tear out your heart

It'll always be mine
Oh, there she go
Losing my head
Say you'll love me to death
'Cause I will

Oh, there she go
Show me you care
Say you'll always be there
'Cause I will

Run, baby, run
Run, baby, run
