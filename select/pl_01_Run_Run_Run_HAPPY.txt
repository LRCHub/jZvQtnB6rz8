When I thought of peace
Did not imagine war
But she cried out so I said
"Don't be sad Irene"
"Look around the world
No overflowing wars"
Everybody stop the fight
and start to run again
Up on heaven's hill
Everyday people are laughing
But she cried out I said
"What happened? Eileen"
"Please leave here right now!
Our dream is ending now"
Everybody stop the laugh
and start to run again
Feeling like we're all born
again
Trying a new ideal
Feeling like we're all born
again
Run to find new ideal
Run run run see her run
Run see her run oh she was
pretty
Run run run see her run
Run see her run oh she was
pretty
Everybody stop the fight and
start to run
Feeling like we're all born
again
