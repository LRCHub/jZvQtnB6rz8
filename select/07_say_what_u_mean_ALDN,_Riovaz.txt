Say what you really mean when you talk to me
I know you wanna see me dead, oh
I know you wanna see me dead (I want you dead)

So tell me what it is that you want from me
'Cause you've been gettin' to my head, oh
Yeah, you've been gettin' to my head

Like I can't go outside without feelin' like someone's behind me
And I'm so paranoid, can't you hurry up and fucking kill me?
Like I can't even hide without feelin' like they're gonna find me
And I'm so paranoid, can't you hurry up and fucking kill me?

Say what you wanna say, girl, I won't mind
And I know I'm wasting your time
And I know I'm wasting your trust (Do- do you trust me?)
And I'm not complicated, I just don't care
Feel like I'm tied to a dream
You've got me down on my knees, for the one who hates me

And I don't fall in love like she does
And I don't fall in love like she does
'Cause I don't
'Cause I don't
Say what you wanna say, I've lost my mind (My mind)
Can't say what you (Say what you)
Say what you mean (Mean)

So tell me what it is that you want from me?
'Cause you've been gettin' to my head, oh
Yeah, you've been gettin' to my head

Like I can't go outside without feeling like someone's behind me
And I'm so paranoid, can't you hurry up and fucking kill me?
Like I can't even hide without feelin' like they're gonna find me
And I'm so paranoid, can't you hurry up and fucking kill me?
