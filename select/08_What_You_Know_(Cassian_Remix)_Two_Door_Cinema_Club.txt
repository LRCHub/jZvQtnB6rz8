In a few weeks, I will get time
To realise it's right before my eyes
And I can take it if it's what I want to do
And I am leaving and this is starting
To feel like it's right before my eyes
And I can taste it, it's my sweet beginning

Maybe next year, I'll have no time
To think about the questions to address
Am I the one to try to stop the fire?
I wouldn't test you, I'm not the best you
Could have attained, why try anything?
I will get there, just remember I know

And I can tell just what you want
You don't want to be alone
And I can't say it's what you know
Yeah, you've known it the whole time

And I can tell just what you want
You don't want to be alone
And I can't say it's what you know
Yeah, you've known it the whole time

And I can tell just what you want
You don't want to be alone
And I can't say it's what you know
Yeah, you've known it the whole time
