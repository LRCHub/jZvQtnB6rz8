```lrc
[00:01.41] On your own, sitting there
[00:11.12] Hands going through your hair
[00:21.20] With eyes closed you recall
[00:31.27] The devide and then the fall
[00:45.27] 
[00:41.53] Emptied your heart
[00:49.04] Emptied your soul
[00:53.85] Mind fell apart
[01:01.35] 
[00:59.30] Your dreams are void
[01:03.91] You're paranoid
[01:11.65] Want to restart
[01:19.15] 
[01:42.40] Staring down at your feet
[01:51.54] That old bench your trusted seat
[02:02.22] Wanting for things to change
[02:11.78] Life became wicked and strange
[02:26.78] 
[02:22.42] Emptied your heart
[02:30.03] Emptied your soul
[02:34.42] Mind fell apart
[02:41.92] 
[02:40.74] Your dreams are void
[02:45.21] You're paranoid
[02:52.04] Want to restart
